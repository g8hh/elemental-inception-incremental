				"After a few days of tinkering with Elements I discovered Golems.\n"+
				"Touching all of them at the same time created some sort of bright flash.\n"+
				"I saw an old man running towards me, and his shout rendered me unconscious.\n"+
				"Later on I woke up in the middle of the attic, but everything else there was gone.\n\n"+
				"A few hours later I recovered enough to move again.\n"+
				"Walking out of the house presented me with another surprise.\n"+
				"It appears I was there for a long time. Looking at the date on the freshest newspaper...\n"+
				"7 months ago I went out looking out for machine parts. 7 months.\n\n"+
				"As this revelation slowly started sinking in I remembered the state my father was.\n"+
				"Scholars gave him only few weeks... I went to the clinic.\n"+
				"\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"+
				"The sadness that I felt for the past months slowly turned into hatred towards that old man in vision.\n"+
				"If it wasn't for him I would at least be with my father during his last breaths.\n"+
				"I know what I want to do. I want to go back there.\n\n"+
				"The fused Elemental Glove in my right arm wasn't something that old man wanted.\n"+
				"Now I was able to hold two different Elements in it at the same time.\n"+
				"But whenever I try to do something, white light appears around my chest\n"+
				"and after few seconds causes a nullifying elemental wave. It is like a curse.\n\n"+
				"I still should be able to do all the things I could before, I just need to\n"+
				"improve my equipment. And so my preparations began.\n"+
				"\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"+
				"A few months have passed.\n\n"+
				"I gathered a lot more machine parts and remade the machines I used last time.\n"+
				"During that time I made two big discoveries. First - compression crystals made with my Glove\n"+
				"are a bit different. They seems to infinitely compress elements. Applying them\n"+
				"to machines and Orbs was surprisingly easy. I remade 4 Orbs into room-sized Tanks\n"+
				"and gathered a bunch more for Golem experiments. I think I'm ready to make a push for it.\n\n"+
				"With new crystals I was able to reverse engineer how they link to other side.\n"+
				"I should be able to make a small rifts and pull Elements directly from it.\n"+
				"\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

				"The problem is... I don't know how the Catalyst in my grandma's attic was made.\n"+
				"Well, I'll just remake its shape and we'll see how it goes from there.\n\n"+
				"That's interesting. I don't really understand why it's increasing efficiency of reactions, but\n"+
				"surrounding it with Air seems to increase speed of reactions as well.\n"+
				"I think focusing Fire around the Catalyst lessens natural barriers and pulls more\n"+
				"Elements from the same source as the rifts.\n\n"+
				"Anyway, with the Catalyst ready I just need to install it in the middle of the room.\n"+

				"about Elements. I'll modify the Catalyst to go on the outside of the conversion machines.\n"+

				"I don't want to randomly cause their creation anymore, so I devised special machine.\n"+
				"The infusion chamber will let me control the processes with valves. With few dozen\n"+
				"empty Orbs I'll even be able to try making multiple Golems of same type.\n"+

				"Losing all my Elements each time I create a Golem is slowing my progress a lot.\n"+

				"Waves propagate through the space using small bits of Elements that naturally appear\n"+
				"in the world around me. And waves from my curse are a bit weaker than Golem ones,\n"+
				"so they only get to tanks that I used during upgrading processes. This means a simple\n"+
				"isolation barrier should be able to stop waves from getting inside my containers.\n\n"+
				"Sadly using that barrier inside my tanks would render them unusable with\n"+
				"my current subspace piping technology, I should still be able to make a special container\n"+
				"that'd be safe from waves. Pumping Elements in and out of it will be problematic.\n"+
				"Well, I have a plan. I'll only be able to retrieve a small portion of stored Elements\n"+
				"after each wave created during process of upgrading or golem creation, but it's better\n"+

				"That's... insane. There are only 4 Elements. What's inside new one? I cannot interact\n"+
				"with it using my gloved arm. For now I just have to make sure this accident doesn't\n"+
				"happen again. From now on I'll put all golems on stable pedestals.\n\n\n"+
				"Experimenting with new golems is the most interesting thing I've ever done.\n"+
				"While I used normal Golems to help with gathering their respective Elements I cannot\n"+
				"do the same with this one. But it emanates a faint aura that spread across the room and\n"+
				"it seems that it enhanced my machines in some weird way. I'll try to document details of\n"+
				"that power later. Now the question is... if that combination of base Golems created this,\n"+
				"then what happens when I try another combination?\n\n"+
				"Thanks to all my experiences with creating Golems I was able to construct tiny versions\n"+
				"of Orbs. I only need a bit of Element to turn them into Golems, but they dissipate after\n"+
				"a few minutes. Thanks to their size I was able to contain their waves inside for isolated study.\n"+
				"With them I've done more tests and indeed all combinations of base Golems create different\n"+
				"'advanced' Golems. I've also tested their powers and they are so much different then\n"+
				"anything I've seen before. My next goal should be making as many of them as possible.\n"+

				"nothing at some point. I suspect that after point it'll actually start to drain\n"+

				"Confused I looked around. Spikes on walls. So it did happen. The spikes nearest me\n"+
				"are still covered in blood, yet I don't have any wounds. My body looked just as\n"+
				"always until I noticed the glass globe in my left arm, marking a spot I was\n"+
				"hit by the Infernal. That's... at this point I wasn't even surprised.\n"+
				"I started thinking what could that mean and how could I use it...\n\n"+
				"While thinking, I noticed another small glass globe on the floor near me.\n"+
				"I guess those are remains of the Infernal Golem. I reached out to pick it up, but\n"+
